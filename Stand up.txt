Good to be here, I'm not acually from here I'm from Texas I moved here about 2 years ago. And boy I thought they loved God down there. The first thing I noticed
when I moved here was the way the street system works. Everyhting said fuckin 600 S 300 W or whatever and I was like what are we counting down too oo this is so exciting. 
Maybe theres a secret treasure. Maybe DB cooper actually crashed here! Or maybe some schitzo guy looked in a hat in 1830 and conviced everyone god said to build a temple 
so he could have 15 wives or whatever. I'm not actually too sure about the details of mormonism. Mormons whole religion sounds like it was made up by a drunk 15 year describing
his ideal life. He's like "And guys can have as many wives as they want and lead the church and get all the jobs! And girls can be my WIFE! And when I die I can get a planet 
for myself and the girls can be on my planet too to feed me or whatever."
